		<h2> Subject: File Structure and Transfer </h2>
		<p> In this lab, we are looking at how to reffer to other files within our file structure
		</p>
		<h2> Difficutlies </h2>
		<p> The difficulties I faced within this lab was all in the CSS. I was struggling
	for a while on how to use flexbox and reffering to the parent and children objects in order
	to position elements side by side.

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> The results of my work are clearly shown in my website
with my photo. I think that I am getting the hang of this :)
