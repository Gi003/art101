	<h2> Challenge </h2>
	<p>The challenge for this lab was to be able to use string arrays and objects within a
	Javascript file. </p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
	<p> The problems that I faced thoroughout this lab were mainly within the Java console, as it was
	hard to format and declare variables without having the program auto enter the code for me before I was even done. </p>
