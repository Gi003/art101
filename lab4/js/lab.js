// Creating a digital game of tag:
// 1. Create two objects, both will be players
  // 2. Accept user input in order to create controllability in mobility for both separate players
    // 3.. Assign a value to create the “it”
  // 4. Give player 1 a true value for being it
// 5. Give player 2 a false value for being it
// 6. Set up a condition so that if the proximity of both objects is zero then both of the objects’ individual values will change.
